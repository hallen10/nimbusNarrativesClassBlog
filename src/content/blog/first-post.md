Fallout Equestria is a novel by Kkat that is a crossover between Fallout and ponies. An unusual crossover that takes an interesting spin on the Fallout world. In the next few post I will share with you some of the differences and similarities that the two Fallouts share. 

Fallout: A post nuclear role playing game, is a game where you play as a vault dweller who is trying to save their vault by getting their vault a new water chip. Along the adventures of the vault dweller they run into robots, mutant cows, mutant mole rats, aliens, genetically engineered monsters called deathclaws, etc. Their is a variation of sci-fi weapons in Fallout such as laser weapons and plasma weapons. There are also new drugs in Fallout such as buffout, mentats, hydra, jet, etc. 

Fallout Equestria shares a lot of similarities with the game, such as two major powers causing the end of the world. Also, Fallout Equestria takes a more fantasy approach to its technology than Fallout, such as magic beam weapons instead of laser weapons.
