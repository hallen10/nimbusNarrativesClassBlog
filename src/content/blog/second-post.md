In the Fallout games the nuclear apocalypse starts when China and USA exchange nukes. This war started from a resource war over oil. A lot of Fallout’s history follows our timeline except for after World War II. That is when the Fallout’s timeline diverges from ours it leads to the lack of global oil, which resulted in a war. 

In the Fallout Equestria books the nuclear apocalypse starts when the zebra empire and Equestria start exchanging megaspells, which are powerful spells that have the power to take out cities. The Fallout Equestria’s war starts over the resources of magical gemstones which the zebras used for talismans and weapons, for their dangerous homelands, and the resource coal which the ponies were using for their industrial revolution.
