## Nukes 

In Fallout Equestria instead of nukes, they have megaspells. Megaspells unlike nukes, are not just destructive, in fact for the first megaspell that was casted was developed by the Ministry of Peace, which was a mass healing spell. The megaspell’s plans eventually found it’s way to the zebra lands which led to the development of balefire megaspells, which are weapons of mass destruction. The balefire megaspells are the megaspells that were used mainly in the great war.
